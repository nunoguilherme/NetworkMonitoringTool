# Network Monitoring Tool 👨‍💻🔍

Hey there! Welcome to my Network Monitoring Tool project! 👋 In this project, I've developed a Java-based application that monitors network traffic and detects anomalies. 🌐🚦

## Project Overview 📝

The Network Monitoring Tool is a command-line application that utilizes the power of Java's networking capabilities and multithreading to handle multiple network connections simultaneously. 🚀 By capturing and analyzing network traffic, it helps to identify any irregularities or suspicious activities in real-time. 🔎📊

## Features and Functionality ✨

- 🌐 **Real-time Monitoring**: The tool constantly listens for incoming network connections and captures network traffic.

- 🚦 **Anomaly Detection**: By analyzing network packets, it detects any unusual patterns or suspicious activities.

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: The tool performs statistical analysis on network traffic to identify trends and patterns.

- 📝 **Logging**: It maintains logs of network activities and anomalies detected for later analysis.

## How to Use 🚀

To use the Network Monitoring Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Compile the Java code using the appropriate commands.

3. Run the `Main` class to start the network monitoring tool.

4. Interact with the tool by connecting to it on the specified port (8000).

5. Observe the real-time network monitoring and anomaly detection in action!

## Future Enhancements 🌟

I have some exciting plans to enhance this Network Monitoring Tool further:

- 📈 **Visualization**: Implement graphical representations of network traffic for better visualization and analysis.

- 📟 **Protocol Support**: Extend the tool to support multiple network protocols, such as TCP, UDP, and HTTP.

- ⚠️ **Alerting System**: Integrate an alerting system to notify administrators in case of detected anomalies.

- 🌐 **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to configure and interact with the tool.

## Contribution Guidelines 🤝

I'm open to contributions and ideas to make this Network Monitoring Tool even better! If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and improve the project together!

## Acknowledgements 🙏

I want to express my gratitude to the open-source community and the Java programming language for providing the tools and resources to create this network monitoring tool. It's been an exciting and rewarding journey! 🎉
